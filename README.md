```bash
node test-game.js
```

## Game Modes

### 1. New Game
- Choose your color (White/Black/Random)
- Play a complete game from the starting position

### 2. Continue Game

## Troubleshooting

### Stockfish Not Found
If you get a "Stockfish not found" error:
1. Verify Stockfish is installed at the correct path
2. Update the path in `src/stockfish-engine.ts` if needed
3. Make sure the executable has proper permissions

### Permission Issues
If you get permission errors:
1. Run as administrator
2. Check file permissions on Stockfish executable
3. Verify antivirus isn't blocking the process

### Engine Move Issues
If you get "Invalid move" or "Engine timeout" errors:
1. The engine now properly converts UCI moves to algebraic notation
2. Timeout has been reduced to 3 seconds for faster responses
3. Engine depth is limited to 10 for quicker analysis
4. If issues persist, try restarting the game

### Build Errors
If you get TypeScript compilation errors:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
2. Check TypeScript version: `pnpm exec tsc --version`
3. Clear and rebuild: `pnpm run build`
